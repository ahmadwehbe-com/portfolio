    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
        Nothing fancy, it's the same education as millions of other people.<br />
        Quite the silly thing to base your hiring metric on, eh?<br />
        If he/she can type, isn't a criminal, and washes their damn hands, then that's all the diamond you need.<br />
